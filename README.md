# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning techniques. By analyzing passenger data, including features such as age, gender, socio-economic class, and more, this project seeks to uncover patterns that influenced survival rates.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from the [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data), which provides comprehensive information about the passengers aboard the Titanic.

## Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Preprocess the data for model training.
- Implement and compare various machine learning models for predicting survival.
- Evaluate model performance and determine the most effective approach.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

## Results
The results of the model will provide insights into the factors affecting survival on the Titanic, and the best-performing model will be displayed in the output.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and draw conclusions about survival factors in a real-world scenario. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
